## About me
    I am a 1st year student of the Master's degree in Digital Economy. I began my journey into the IT by studying HTML and CSS in 2018. Practical skills in HTML layout and aesthetic design of elements using CSS I consolidated while working at AwebSystems. Then I discovered JavaScript. I learned how to set elements in motion while scrolling, implement modals, tabs, accordions, timers, carousels, sliders and much more. I learned how to work with the SASS / SCSS and LESS preprocessors, BEM methodology, contexts, closures and AJAX in JavaScript through EPAM cources. In STARTER I apply the acquired knowledge.

    Now I feel that I need to go to the next stage of growth. I want to improve pure JavaScript skills and then I want to learn ReactJS. One of my goals is working in international company in friendly team.
